# Phase 2, Lecture 6: PATCH & DELETE

## Lecture Topics

- fetch => PATCH & DELETE

## Introduction

Today we'll continue to build our app for the pet adoption center, Flatapets, that displays a list of pets available for adoption at this pet adoption center. We will be adding a feature that will allow the user to click a "Like" button which will increase the number of likes for that pet when clicked. We will also add functionality to make a PATCH request to persist the updated number of likes for the pet. We will also be adding functionality to make a DELETE request when the user clicks the "Adopt" button to adopt a pet to permanently delete the pet from the database. Finally, we will be adding a feature that will toggle between displaying the name of the pet and the type of animal for the pet when the user clicks on the `<h4>` element where the name or type of animal for the pet would display. We will be using the concepts learned in this lecture to build out these new features in this app.

## Setup

1. Run `npm install` in your terminal to install the dependencies for this React app.
2. Run `npm run server`. This will run your backend on port `4000`.
3. In a new terminal, run `npm start` in your terminal to run this React app in the browser. If your browser does not automatically open the page for you, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

In our React application, the data about the Pets is in the `db.json` file. This file will mimic an API that follows RESTful conventions.

Make sure to open [http://localhost:4000/pets](http://localhost:4000/pets) in the browser to verify that your backend is working before you proceed!
